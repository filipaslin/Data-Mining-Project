Violating Twitter's policy against posting private information. Writer Mara Hvistendahl published an article in The Intercept alleging that Oracle was marketing its data analytics software to police and security contractors in China. Glueck issued a rebuttal to the piece on Oracle's website, asking readers with "any information about Mara or her reporting" to contact him at his personal ProtonMail email address. Hvistendahl tweeted a screenshot of this sentence in Glueck's rebuttal, including Glueck's email address. Glueck then tweeted Hvistendahl's professional email address and Signal phone number, which were published in her original article, as a way to "return the favor". Twitter suspended Glueck's account for 12 hours; Hvistendahl's account was not suspended. Glueck's request for information on Hvistendahl was later removed from his rebuttal.
